## Coding Question Practice

Now that you know all the computer science topics above, it's time to practice answering coding problems.

**Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.**

Why you need to practice doing programming problems:
- Problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in
- Gathering requirements for the problem
- Talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview
- Coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer
- Coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions
- Testing your solutions

There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming
interview books, too, but I found this outstanding:

No whiteboard at home? That makes sense. I'm a weirdo and have a big whiteboard. Instead of a whiteboard, pick up a
large drawing pad from an art store. You can sit on the couch and practice. This is my "sofa whiteboard".
I added the pen in the photo for scale. If you use a pen, you'll wish you could erase. Gets messy quick. I use a pencil
and eraser.

## Coding exercises/challenges

Once you've learned your brains out, put those brains to work.
Take coding challenges every day, as many as you can.

## Your Resume

- See Resume prep items in Cracking The Coding Interview and back of Programming Interviews Exposed
- Very Important thing to remember while creating your resume, if you applying for big companies is that make it ATS Compliant.

## Be thinking of for when the interview comes

Think of about 20 interview questions you'll get, along with the lines of the items below. Have 2-3 answers for each.
Have a story, not just data, about something you accomplished.

- Why do you want this job?
- What's a tough problem you've solved?
- Biggest challenges faced?
- Best/worst designs seen?
- Ideas for improving an existing product
- How do you work best, as an individual and as part of a team?
- Which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why?
- What did you most enjoy at [job x / project y]?
- What was the biggest challenge you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What was the hardest bug you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What did you learn at [job x / project y]?
- What would you have done better at [job x / project y]?


- If you find hard to come up with good answers of this type interview questions, you can refer below link for some answer templates and have some idea. 
- [General Interview Questions and their Answers](https://ayedot.com/119/MiniBlog/General-Interview-Questions-and-their-Answers-for-Tech-Jobs)


## Have questions for the interviewer

    Some of mine (I already may know answer to but want their opinion or team perspective):

- How large is your team?
- What does your dev cycle look like? Do you do waterfall/sprints/agile?
- Are rushes to deadlines common? Or is there flexibility?
- How are decisions made in your team?
- How many meetings do you have per week?
- Do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate?
- What are you working on?
- What do you like about it?
- What is the work life like?
- How is work/life balance?
